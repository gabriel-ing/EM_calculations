# EM_calculations

This is a series of jupyter notebooks which have been used to plot various figures for my thesis. I have published this code to allow anyone to see how I have calculated these plots, spot errors and use the information for their own projects. 

Currently I have notebooks on: 

- The Stokes-Einstein equation and theoretical modelling of conventional Brownian motion and rotation
- Plotting of standard and anomalous diffusion
- The resolution limit due to chromatic blurring by thickness.
- Radiolysis simulation plots with simulations from Birk Fritsch and colleagues.
